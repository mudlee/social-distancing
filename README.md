# Social Distancing

This game was made for Stay Safe! Jam.

## Epic Story

A cold, snowy day. Due to the global pandemic the government restricts people aged 65 and over to go to grocery stores only between 9AM and 12PM.
Even in this case they must keep distance on the street.

Your task is to plan each of the grandmas' shopping route to the grocery store and keep the infection rate below 60%.

## Goal & Rules

Be aware that one of them is already secretly infected, hence avoid crossing  routes as they immediately infect each other.
Also, all grandmas have to visit each and every store.
